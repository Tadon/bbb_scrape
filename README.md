# bbb_scrape
BBB Scraping project.
search_information.py omitted to prevent "plug and play". Not intended to be used, just a fun project.
Same concept as YP 2.0, new concept introduced here is to combat rate limiting.
When "rate limiting is detected", scraping will wait until limitation has ceased, then begin again.
